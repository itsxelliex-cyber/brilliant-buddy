# brilliant-buddy
this is my second project, brilliant buddy! its a website for students, targeted towards elementary school kids, and it can be a good study resource for them to catch up on subjects and track their assignments. there is also an option for teachers to grade assignments too!

WHY i made this website: orginally i wanted to create this as an app for the congressional app challenge, but that fell through so i'm reusing this idea for athena award! in any case, i made this because i noticed that my little cousins didn't have somewhere they could keep track of their assignments, so i tried my best to make an engaging site where students could keep track of their work and study. it's kind of like a useful web resource for little kids. it's not perfect and i do intend on touching it up later but this will suffice for now!

HOW i made this website: i used html, css, and javascript! the javascript you see was made mainly for functionality (getting customized welcome on student and teacher portal page and ability to create and track assignments). the html was the structure of the website and the css was mainly for aesthetics.

something i struggled with: i had to relearn javascript so using it was a little challenging because i didn't know how it could coexist with html and css. but i watched a few tutorials and everything started to make sense (huge relief). nevertheless this project was so fun and i cannot wait to start creating my final one in order to recieve the athena award!
